# ChatGPT Labyrinth Game

This is a small labyrinth game using a custom map "map.txt" that can be edited.

It has been coded entirely through the OpenAI chatGPT AI model. See: [game_conversation_chatgpt.pdf](game_conversation_chatgpt.pdf) for a dump of the conversation.

It is meant to show how larger projects can be created using follow-up instructions and requests to split up the code over functions and files.

Run it by `python3 main.py`. The options "Continue" and "Load game" does not work (yet).
