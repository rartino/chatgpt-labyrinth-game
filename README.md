# ChatGPT Labyrinth Game

This is a small labyrinth game in python, using a custom map "map.txt" that can be edited.

It has been coded entirely through the OpenAI chatGPT AI model. See: [game_conversation_chatgpt.pdf](game_conversation_chatgpt.pdf) for a dump of the conversation.

It is meant to show how a larger code can be created through the AI model by going back and forth and asking it to split ut the code in functions and files.
